# Iris Flower Species Predictor ðŸŒ¸



This project is a web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower. Users can input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and the machine learning model will classify the flower as one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.

This was created for my Python assignment Mini Project.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
* **Flask / Streamlit**: [Choose one, or list the framework you used] for creating the web interface.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
